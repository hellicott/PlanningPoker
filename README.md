# PlanningPoker

This is a project to allow engineering teams to play planning poker remotely. They can set up a virtual meeting room and team members can join using a shared room name. They can then choose their card. The room contains options to show or hide all cards, as well as reset when you move on to the next item to estimate.

This is a beginners web project and definitely has some improvements to be made
